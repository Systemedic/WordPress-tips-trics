Here you will find PHP snippets, CSS and other tips and trics for WordPress.
It's a combination of snippets I found myself and adjusted a bit to my needs and stuff that I just copied.

For placing the snippets you can use the following plugin: https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/ or simply putting them in the functions.php of your child! theme.

Have fun :-)
